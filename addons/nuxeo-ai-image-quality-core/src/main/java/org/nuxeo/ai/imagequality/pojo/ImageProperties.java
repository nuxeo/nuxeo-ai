 * The Properties end point helps you determine the quality of an image

 * <p>
 * ================================
 * Sharpness / Blurriness Detection
 * ================================
 * <p>
 * The Image Properties API can help you determine the perceived sharpness or blurriness
 * of an Image through the "sharpness" property.
 * <p>
 * The returned value is between 0 and 1. Images with a sharpness value closer to 1 will
 * be sharper while images with a sharpness value closer to 0 will be perceived as blurrier.
 * <strong>RECOMMENDED THRESHOLDS</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Below 0.4: Very blurry</li>
 * <li>Between 0.4 and 0.6: Blurry</li>
 * <li>Between 0.6 and 0.8: Slightly blurry</li>
 * <li>Between 0.8 and 0.9: Sharp</li>
 * <li>Between 0.9 and 1: Very sharp</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * =======================
 * Brightness Detection
 * =======================
 * <p>
 * The brightness of the image is returned as a between 0 and 1. Images with a value closer to 1 will be
 * brighter while images with a value closer to 0 will be darker.
 * <strong>RECOMMENDED THRESHOLDS</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Equal or inferior to 0.2: Very dark</li>
 * <li>Between 0.2 and 0.4: Dark</li>
 * <li>Between 0.4 and 0.6: Low brightness</li>
 * <li>Between 0.6 and 0.8: Bright</li>
 * <li>Between 0.8 and 1: Very bright</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * =======================
 * Contrast Detection
 * =======================
 * The returned value is between 0 and 1.
 * <strong>RECOMMENDED THRESHOLDS</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Equal or inferior to 0.3: Low contrast</li>
 * <li>Between 0.3 and 0.7: Average contrast</li>
 * <li>Between 0.7 and 1: High contrast</li>
