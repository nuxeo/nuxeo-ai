#### Indexing and Search
It is recommended that the Elasticsearch mappings are updated to allow a full text search on enrichment labels.
 The following code will add this mapping to a server running locally.
```
curl -X PUT \
  http://localhost:9200/nuxeo/_mapping/doc/ \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

## Nuxeo AI Core
Nuxeo AI Core provides 3 Java modules:
  * nuxeo-ai-core - Contains the core interfaces and AI component
  * nuxeo-ai-pipes - Nuxeo Pipes, short for "Pipelines" provides the ability to operate with [Nuxeo Stream](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo/tree/master/nuxeo-runtime/nuxeo-stream).  Nuxeo Stream provides a Log storage abstraction and a Stream processing pattern. Nuxeo Stream has implementations with [Chronicle Queues](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Queue) or [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/).
  * nuxeo-ai-model - Adds support for custom machine learning models

### Features
 * Provides an `AIComponent` to register services.  eg. An enrichment service.
 * Interfaces and helper classes for building services.
 * Provides a `EnrichingStreamProcessor` to act on a stream using an Java `EnrichmentProvider`.
 * An Operation called `EnrichmentOp` to call an `EnrichmentProvider` and return the result.
 * Provides a `RestClient` and `RestEnrichmentProvider` for easily calling a custom json rest api.
 * Provides a `ThresholdComponents` to register type/facet based thresholds. 
 ```xml
<extension target="org.nuxeo.ai.configuration.ThresholdComponent"
             point="thresholdConfiguration">
    <thresholdConfiguration type="Document"
                            global="0.8">
      <thresholds>
        <threshold xpath="dc:title"
                   value="0.6"
                   autofill="0.65"
                   autocorrect="0.70"/>
      </thresholds>
    </thresholdConfiguration>
</extension>
```
  
  * Continues Export - to enable such you must contribute a cron contribution to your instance. 
  It has to fire `startContinuousExport` at a give time. 
  For instance to export weekly you might use the following example:
  ```xml
    <extension target="org.nuxeo.ecm.core.scheduler.SchedulerService" point="schedule">
        <schedule id="continuous_export_default">
          <event>startContinuousExport</event>
          <!-- At 03:00 AM, every 7 days -->
          <cronExpression>0 0 3 */7 * ?</cronExpression>
        </schedule>
      </extension>
  ```
  On such event the system will retrieve all AI Model defined under
  configured project and perform evaluation of the current data to check if it needs to be uploaded.
  

## Nuxeo Pipes
### Features
 * Enables sending custom events to a nuxeo stream.
 * Provides a `FunctionStreamProcessorTopology` to act on a stream using a Java `Function<T, R>`.
 * Provides 4 customizable document streams:
    * `images` - When a image is added to a document.
    * `videos` - When a video is added to a document.
    * `audio` - When an audio file is added to a document.
    * `text` - When binary text is extracted from a document.

These streams are *disabled by default* but can be enabled by the [corresponding configuration parameters](#configuration-parameters).

### Customization
##### Sample configuration for DAM Installations.
The [configuration parameters](#configuration-parameters) are used to configure Nuxeo xml contributions, instead you can provide your own configuration that meets your requirements.

A [Sample DAM configuration is available to download](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-ai/blob/master/nuxeo-ai-pipes/src/test/resources/ai-dam-config.xml), and defines 2 pipelines:
###### Images Pipeline
 * Listens for `pictureViewsGenerationDone` and sends `picture:views/3/content` to the `images` stream.
 * Configures an `EnrichingStreamProcessor` to read from the  `images` stream, calls the `aws.celebrityDetection` enrichment service and puts the response in the `ai/images-enrichment-in` stream.
 * The next stream processor reads from the `ai/images-enrichment-in` stream, and raises an `imageMetadataCreated` event for each new enrichment entry.
 * An example listener for the  `imageMetadataCreated` event writes a log message.

###### Video Pipeline
 * Listens for new `vid:storyboard` modifications for a document in a path containing `movies` and sends 4 of the video storyboard images to the `video` stream.
 * Configures an `EnrichingStreamProcessor` to read from the `video` stream, calls the `aws.imageLabels` enrichment service and puts the response in the `ai/video-enrichment-in` stream.
 * The next stream processor reads from the `ai/video-enrichment-in` stream and creates document tags for the enrichment labels.

Please note that the `EnrichingStreamProcessors` are using a stream processing policy of `continueOnFailure=true`, this means that *stream processing will continue even if the enrichment failed*.

##### Events
Using an Nuxeo extension you can dynamically register a pipeline for any custom event.  
For example to send `MY_EVENT` to a stream called `mystream` you would use the following configuration.
```xml
  <extension point="pipes" target="org.nuxeo.ai.Pipeline">
    <pipe id="pipe.mypipe" enabled="true" function="org.nuxeo.my.DocumentPipeFunction">
      <supplier>
        <event name="MY_EVENT">
          <filter class="org.nuxeo.ai.pipes.filters.NotSystemOrProxyFilter"/>
        </event>
      </supplier>
      <consumer>
        <stream name="mystream" />
      </consumer>
    </pipe>
  </extension>
```
Transforming an input Event into an output stream is done using a function specified by the `function` parameter. Functions are explained below.

##### Nuxeo Insight Cloud enrichments

To enable/disable Nuxeo Insight Cloud enrichers based on your custom model set `nuxeo.ai.insight.enrichment.enabled` to the desired value.
Default value is `true`

##### Custom enrichment services
 New enrichment services can be added by implementing `EnrichmentProvider`.  `AbstractEnrichmentProvider` is a good starting point.
 If you wish to call a custom rest api then extending `RestEnrichmentProvider` would allow access to the various `RestClient`
 helper methods. To register your extension you would use configuration similar to this.
 ```xml
  <extension point="enrichment" target="org.nuxeo.ai.services.AIComponent">
    <enrichment name="custom1" kind="/classification/custom"
                class="org.nuxeo.ai.custom.CustomModelEnrichmentProvider" maxSize="10000000">
      <option name="minConfidence">0.75</option>
    </enrichment>
  </extension>
```

##### Functions
Actions on streams or events are based on the standard Java `Function<T, R>` interface.  To send an event to a stream you would need to implement the `Function<Event, Record>` interface. `Record` is the type used for items in a nuxeo-stream.
For examples, look at `PropertiesToStream` and its helper class `DocEventToStream`.

These is also a `FilterFunction` that first tests a `Predicate` before applying the function.  Predicates can be built with the help of the `Predicates` class.
 To create a predicate for _only document events with documents which are not system documents or proxies and aren't "Folderish"_ you would use this predicate: `docEvent(notSystem().and(d -> !d.hasFacet("Folderish"))`.

##### Stream processing
Stream processing is achieved using a computation stream pattern that enables you to compose producers/consumers into a complex topology.

To use a custom processor, create a class that implements `FunctionStreamProcessorTopology` and specify it in the `class` parameter as shown below.

```xml
<extension target="org.nuxeo.runtime.stream.service" point="streamProcessor">
<streamProcessor name="basicProcessor" defaultConcurrency="1" defaultPartitions="4"
               class="org.nuxeo.my.custom.StreamProcessor">
 <option name="source">ai/mystream</option>
 <option name="sink">ai/mystream-out</option>
</streamProcessor>
</extension>
```

##### Enrichment stream processing
You can register your custom enrichment services to act as a stream processor using the `EnrichingStreamProcessor`.
For example, the following configuration would register a stream processor that acts on a source stream called `images`,
it runs the `custom1` enrichment service on each record and sends the result to the `ai/enrichment-in` stream.
```xml
<extension target="org.nuxeo.runtime.stream.service" point="streamProcessor">
<streamProcessor name="myCustomProcessor1" defaultConcurrency="2" defaultPartitions="4"                 
                 class="org.nuxeo.ai.enrichment.EnrichingStreamProcessor">
  <option name="source">ai/images</option>
  <option name="sink">ai/enrichment-in</option>
  <option name="enrichmentProviderName">custom1</option>
</streamProcessor>
</extension>
```
### Monitoring
Nuxeo AI adds additional metrics to the standard [Nuxeo Metrics reporting](https://doc.nuxeo.com/nxdoc/metrics-and-monitoring/#metrics).


| Metric name | Metric
| --- | --- |
|nuxeo.ai.streams.[eventListener].events| Count of events received.|
|nuxeo.ai.streams.[eventListener].consumed| Count of events that matched the filter condition and were processed.|
| nuxeo.ai.enrichment.[enrichmentProvider].called| Count of stream records received. |
| nuxeo.ai.enrichment.[enrichmentProvider].errors| Count of errors.|
| nuxeo.ai.enrichment.[enrichmentProvider].produced| How many records were produced after calling the service.|
| nuxeo.ai.enrichment.[enrichmentProvider].retries| Count of retries.|
| nuxeo.ai.enrichment.[enrichmentProvider].cacheHit| Count of times the result was returned from the cache rather than calling the enrichment service.|
| nuxeo.ai.enrichment.[enrichmentProvider].unsupported| Count of unprocessable records, perhaps due to mime-type or size.|
| nuxeo.ai.enrichment.[enrichmentProvider].success| Count of successful calls.|
| nuxeo.ai.enrichment.[enrichmentProvider].circuitbreaker| Incremented when the circuilt breaker is open, stopping the stream from any more processing.|
| nuxeo.ai.enrichment.[enrichmentProvider].fatal| Incremented when a fatal error occurs stopping the stream from any more processing.|
| nuxeo.ai.streams.func.[functionName].called| Count of stream records received.|
| nuxeo.ai.streams.func.[functionName].errors| Count of errors.|
| nuxeo.ai.streams.func.[functionName].produced| How many records were produced by the function.|

### Notes
* When using the Chronicle implementation of nuxeo-stream you should make sure your `defaultPartitons` setting for
stream processors matches the number of partitions you have, eg. 4.

#### Useful log config:
Edit `$NUXEO_HOME/lib/log4j2.xml`, in the `<Appenders>` section, add a `AI-FILE` appender:
```xml
<RollingFile name="AI-FILE" fileName="${sys:nuxeo.log.dir}/nuxeo-ai.log"
             filePattern="${sys:nuxeo.log.dir}/nuxeo-ai-%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.log.gz" append="true">
  <PatternLayout pattern="%d{ISO8601} %-5p [%t] [%c] %m%n" />
  <CronTriggeringPolicy schedule="0 0 0 * * ?" evaluateOnStartup="true" /> <!-- Rollover at midnight every day -->
  <DefaultRolloverStrategy />
</RollingFile>
```
Then in the `<Loggers>` section, add a logger pointing to the `AI-FILE` appender:
```xml
<Logger name="org.nuxeo.ai" level="debug">
  <AppenderRef ref="AI-FILE" />
</Logger>
```

#### Useful stream commands:

[Nuxeo Stream](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo/tree/master/nuxeo-runtime/nuxeo-stream) is either implemented with [Chronicle Queues](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Queue) or [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/).  To watch the progress of messages in the stream you can use:
```
$NUXEO_HOME/bin/stream.sh --help
```
For example, to see the last 8 messages in the "images" stream, for chronicle you would use the first command below (passing in `--chronicle nxserver/data/stream/pipes`) and for Kafka you would use the second command below (passing in just `-k`).
```
./bin/stream.sh tail -n 8 --chronicle nxserver/data/stream/pipes -l images --codec avro
./bin/stream.sh tail -n 8 -k -l images --data-size 2000 --codec avro
```
Similarly, to view the consumer lag on the "images" stream, for chronicle use the first command, and the second for kafka.  The response format is Markdown.
```
./bin/stream.sh lag --chronicle nxserver/data/stream/pipes -l images --verbose
./bin/stream.sh lag -k -l images --verbose
```
### Automatic Property Filling
When a document is enriched with suggestions, the suggestions are stored in the `Enrichment` facet.
It is possible to automatically set a property with a suggested value in two ways.
If the property currently has no value then you can use `Autofill`, if the property already has a value then use `Autocorrect`.

#### Autofill Logic
 * If the target property is `null` or its previously been autofilled then attempt to set the property.
 * Calculate the highest ranking suggestion from the suggestions stored in the "Enrichment" facet.  
    * If its confidence is greater than the threshold returned from the `ThresholdService` then set the property value.
 * If we have already autofilled this property but it doesn't meet the threshold then reset it to `null`.
 * Raise an `AUTO_FILLED` document event.

#### Autocorrect Logic
 * If its previously autofilled then don't attempt an autocorrect because autofill and autocorrect are mutually exclusive.
 * Calculate the highest ranking suggestion from the suggestions stored in the "Enrichment" facet.  
    * If its confidence is greater than the threshold returned from the `ThresholdService` then set the property value.  
    * Save the previous value in the history blob (unless it was previously auto-corrected).
 * If we have already autocorrected this property but it doesn't meet the threshold then reset it to the previous value from the history.
 * Raise an `AUTO_CORRECTED` document event.

#### Stream Bulk Actions
Dataset exports use the [Bulk Action Framework](https://doc.nuxeo.com/nxdoc/bulk-action-framework/).  To track progress of your bulk action you can use a command like this:
```
export COMMAND_ID=your-bulk-action-id
curl -s -X GET "localhost:8080/nuxeo/api/v1/bulk/$COMMAND_ID" -u Administrator:Administrator -H 'content-type: application/json'

```

The documentation on [Debugging The Bulk Action Framework](https://doc.nuxeo.com/nxdoc/bulk-action-framework/#debugging) has more useful stream commands.  Some further examples are:
```
./bin/stream.sh lag --chronicle /var/lib/nuxeo/data/stream/bulk -l bulkDatasetExport
./bin/stream.sh lag --chronicle /var/lib/nuxeo/data/stream/bulk -l exp-training
./bin/stream.sh lag --chronicle /var/lib/nuxeo/data/stream/bulk -l exp-validation
./bin/stream.sh tail -n 8 --chronicle /var/lib/nuxeo/data/stream/bulk -l done --codec avro --schema-store /var/lib/nuxeo/data/avro/ --data-size 3000
./bin/stream.sh tail -n 8 --chronicle /var/lib/nuxeo/data/stream/bulk -l command --codec avro --schema-store /var/lib/nuxeo/data/avro/ --data-size 3000
```
